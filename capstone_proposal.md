## Proposal

Note: _(approx. 2-3 pages)_

### Domain Background

The Titanic data set is famous data set that is part of an introductory Kaggle competition.

It is about the infamous RMS Titanic, an "unsinkable" ship that made the headlines on April 15, 1912. Out of the 2224 passengers and crew, only 1502 of them survived. Although it comes down to chance if a person survives, the data shows that some groups of people have a higher chance of surviving. To solve the problem of identifying those who have a higher chance of survival we will have to come up with a machine learning model that can gives us the probability of someone surviving or not.

I am motivated to finish this project, since I want to get involved with Kaggle. A journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step and also begins at the door.

### Problem Statement

Note: _(approx. 1 paragraph)_

In this section, clearly describe the problem that is to be solved. The problem described should be well defined and should have at least one relevant potential solution. Additionally, describe the problem thoroughly such that it is clear that the problem is quantifiable (the problem can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms) , measurable (the problem can be measured by some metric and clearly observed), and replicable (the problem can be reproduced and occurs more than once).

### Data sets and Inputs

Note: _(approx. 2-3 paragraphs)_

In this section, the data set(s) and/or input(s) being considered for the project should be thoroughly described, such as how they relate to the problem and why they should be used. Information such as how the data set or input is (was) obtained, and the characteristics of the data set or input, should be included with relevant references and citations as necessary It should be clear how the data set(s) or input(s) will be used in the project and whether their use is appropriate given the context of the problem.

### Solution Statement

Note: _(approx. 1 paragraph)_

In this section, clearly describe a solution to the problem. The solution should be applicable to the project domain and appropriate for the data set(s) or input(s) given. Additionally, describe the solution thoroughly such that it is clear that the solution is quantifiable (the solution can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms) , measurable (the solution can be measured by some metric and clearly observed), and replicable (the solution can be reproduced and occurs more than once).

### Benchmark Model

Note: _(approximately 1-2 paragraphs)_

In this section, provide the details for a benchmark model or result that relates to the domain, problem statement, and intended solution. Ideally, the benchmark model or result contextualizes existing methods or known information in the domain and problem given, which could then be objectively compared to the solution. Describe how the benchmark model or result is measurable (can be measured by some metric and clearly observed) with thorough detail.

### Evaluation Metrics

Note: _(approx. 1-2 paragraphs)_

In this section, propose at least one evaluation metric that can be used to quantify the performance of both the benchmark model and the solution model. The evaluation metric(s) you propose should be appropriate given the context of the data, the problem statement, and the intended solution. Describe how the evaluation metric(s) are derived and provide an example of their mathematical representations (if applicable). Complex evaluation metrics should be clearly defined and quantifiable (can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms).

### Project Design

Note: _(approx. 1 page)_

In this final section, summarize a theoretical workflow for approaching a solution given the problem. Provide thorough discussion for what strategies you may consider employing, what analysis of the data might be required before being used, or which algorithms will be considered for your implementation. The workflow and discussion that you provide should align with the qualities of the previous sections. Additionally, you are encouraged to include small visualizations, pseudo-code, or diagrams to aid in describing the project design, but it is not required. The discussion should clearly outline your intended workflow of the capstone project.
